People continue going to Tovarnik to board trains, and buses to Slovenian borders.<br><br>4000 people were on the way to Opatovac via buses early morning 23/10. Camp was reported almost full evening of 22/10. <br><br>Many buses have gone from the camp to Slovenian borders, and people continue being delivered to Tovarnik to take trains.<br>About 500-800 people inside \"green\" sector waiting to be delivered to Tovarnik train station by buses. Situation is very calm.<br><br>Around 1500 people in the camp at night.<br><br>UNHCR got 15 pallets of blankets. CRC gave 2 of it to volunteers to distribute.<br><br>During last hrs. we got the chance to clean up a really messy tent, so MAGNA may use it as a mother/child shelter and rest room again at least tomorrow evening.<br>      <br>By now enough volunteers (about 20) on site, if situation stays like this.<br>Newcomers were brought from Bapska directly to Tovarnik train station. <br><br>Situation in Opatovac may change immediately, if authorities decide to bring people not directly to train station anymore.<br><br>As cold as 4°C at night.<br><br>Croatian prime minister said no one will be held in camp for more than 24 hours and no one will be driven to the Hungarian border (Beremend). Trains go to Botovo border crossing. Opatovac camp is the hotspot for now, locate some volunteers in the area and get the most updated info.<br><br>Supply needs: Blankets and emergency mylar blankets needed!!! Not nearly enough blankets. Food, dry and canned food, fruit; food for babies and milk.<br><br>Shoes (size 39-45), socks, childrens and mens jackets.

People continue going to Tovarnik to board trains, and buses to Slovenian borders.\n\n4000 people were on the way to Opatovac via buses early morning 23/10. Camp was reported almost full evening of 22/10.\n\nMany buses have gone from the camp to Slovenian borders, and people continue being delivered to Tovarnik to take trains.\nAbout 500-800 people inside \"green\" sector waiting to be delivered to Tovarnik train station by buses. Situation is very calm.\n\nAround 1500 people in the camp at night.\n\nUNHCR got 15 pallets of blankets. CRC gave 2 of it to volunteers to distribute.\n\nDuring last hrs. we got the chance to clean up a really messy tent, so MAGNA may use it as a mother/child shelter and rest room again at least tomorrow evening.\n      \nBy now enough volunteers (about 20) on site, if situation stays like this.\nNewcomers were brought from Bapska directly to Tovarnik train station. \n\nSituation in Opatovac may change immediately, if authorities decide to bring people not directly to train station anymore.\n\nAs cold as 4°C at night.\n\nCroatian prime minister said no one will be held in camp for more than 24 hours and no one will be driven to the Hungarian border (Beremend). Trains go to Botovo border crossing. Opatovac camp is the hotspot for now, locate some volunteers in the area and get the most updated info.\n",

But still all refugees are allowed to transit through Sweden.<br><br>Refugees get here by train from Copenaghen (Denmark), by ferry from Rostock or Travemunde (Germany) or from Germany to Trelleborg, and then they reach Malmö. <br><br>At this time there is one places set up- Kontrapunkt (normally a culture organisation houses and feeds 200 people every night), the Turkish mosque is currently not taking in any refugees. Refugees stay for one night and are thereafter encouraged to seek asylum at the migration board. If they instead wish to travel forward there are buses leaving to Stockholm almost every day. The organization is looking to buy a bus so any information on good buses are very welcome.  <br><br>40-50 volunteers onsite daily.<br><br>There is a volunteer center at the central station open 24 hours to help guide refugees either to the migration authorities or other places to sleep. <br><br>Kontrapunkt is struggling to pay rent for their place. They cook three meals a day for everyone. It also pays buses for refugees who wants to head to  Stockholm that it's meant for who wants to go to Finland, but after that refugees are sent halfway back to Malmö.

NO WATER, NO FOOD, NO BLANKETS, NO SHELTER. Hardly any water distributed daily, mostly to the sick (about 100 people). \n\nNational police: very helpful, working hand-in-hand with volunteers. Kind treatment of refugees and volunteers. -Civil protection police: VERY BAD treatment of refugees -> Using violence and dogs, and violating fundamental human rights.\n\nPolice are slowly driving people by bus to Sentilj and Jesenice on the Austrian border.
